# **Blender Animation to TLoD Animation (SAF)**
***
---
This is an addon for Blender 2.80, for convert Blender Animation-Transforms of Objects,
into Animations for TLoD (SAF - Simple Animation File). 
You can make a new animation, once the baking is done, you need to adjust some parameters,
finally you can press the Conversion button on the 3D View Panel to convert into SAF,
the file will under a folder with the name of the Model, with the name "Converted.saf".
After you need to find the file you want to replace using the File Mapping Document,
going into the SC files folder and replace the file you want to change.
Anyhow, don't worry i will be uploading a Tutorial on "How to Work" with this tool
